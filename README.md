A step-by-step workflow of how data flows through your React components based on the code you provided:

App.js:

App.js is the entry point of your React application.
It renders two main divs, one for the card list and one for the selected cards.
It imports card data from data.json.
It maintains a selectedCards state using the useState hook to store selected card titles.
It defines a function handleCardSelect that takes a selected title and updates the selectedCards state with the new title.
Flow:

<CODE/>
<!-- App.js -> CardList.js (with card data and onSelect callback) -> Card.js
CardList.js: -->

CardList.js receives the cards prop from App.js, which is an array of card data.
It also receives the onSelect callback function from App.js.
It uses the map function to iterate over the cards array and render individual Card components, passing the cardData and the onSelect callback to each Card.
Flow:

<CODE/>
<!-- App.js -> CardList.js -> Card.js (for each card in the map)
Card.js: -->

Card.js receives the cardData and onSelect callback function as props from CardList.js.
It renders an individual card with the data received from cardData.
When a card is clicked, it calls the handleClick function, which in turn calls the onSelect callback function, passing the cardData.title as an argument.
Flow:

<CODE/>
<!-- App.js -> CardList.js -> Card.js (for each card in the map)
App.js (handleCardSelect): -->

When a card is clicked in the Card.js component, the handleClick function is called.
The handleClick function calls the onSelect callback function that was passed down from App.js.
It passes the cardData.title as an argument.
In the App.js component, the handleCardSelect function receives the selected title and updates the selectedCards state with the new title.
Flow:

<CODE/>
<!-- Card.js -> App.js (handleCardSelect)
App.js (Render Selected Cards): -->

The selectedCards state in App.js stores the selected card titles.
These selected card titles are then mapped and displayed in the "Selected Cards" section of the component.
Flow:

<CODE/>
<!-- App.js (selectedCards) -> Rendered "Selected Cards" -->
This workflow demonstrates how data and functions are passed between the App.js, CardList.js, and Card.js components to achieve the desired functionality of selecting and displaying card titles.

<!-- setSelectedCards([...selectedCards, cardData.title])  -->
The setSelectedCards([...selectedCards, cardData.title]) expression is used to update the selectedCards state in a way that preserves the previous values and adds a new title to the list. It doesn't overwrite the old titles; instead, it appends the new title to the existing array.


<!-- Use an Array in place of spread Operator -->
use an array directly to maintain the list of selected titles. Instead of spreading the existing array, you can use the array directly in the state update. Here's how you can do it:

<!-- jsx
Copy code
const handleCardSelect = (selectedTitle) => {
  setSelectedCards([...selectedCards, selectedTitle]);
}; -->
This code spreads the existing selectedCards array and adds the selectedTitle to it, creating a new array. If you want to use an array directly, you can do it like this:

<!-- jsx
Copy code
const handleCardSelect = (selectedTitle) => {
  setSelectedCards(selectedCards.concat(selectedTitle));
}; -->
Here, we use the concat method to concatenate the selectedTitle to the existing selectedCards array, creating a new array.

Both approaches achieve the same result: appending the selected title to the list of selected titles without overwriting the old titles. You can choose the one that you find more readable and maintainable for your code.
